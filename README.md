# race

Click the pencil to add a list of comma-delimmited racers (initials preferably)

Alternatively entering a number will generate a list of racers between 1 and the number provided, or entering ABC will generate a list of racers between A and Z

This can also be programmatically done by appending /?5 or &abc to the URL https://rdmdk.github.io/race/
